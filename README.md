Qt application for Finger Print Sensor GT-511C3

This project was developed using the latest QtCreator (3.1.2 at the time of
writing of this doc) and Qt SDK version 5.3.1.

It uses the Qt5 serial library (if available) and it can fall back to a simple RS232 serial
communication http://www.teuniz.net/RS-232/.
